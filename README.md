# OOP-Auction

This is a university project that was meant to teach us good practices in OOP. The program by itself is a World of Warcraft like action house. It has players who have their own inventories with items. Players can sell these items in the auction house. The program uses polymorphism, encapsulation, inheritance and much more.
